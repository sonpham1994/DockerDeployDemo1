declare you AKS name
AKS_NAME="aksnm01"

But in order for Kubernetes to pull the image from Azure Container Registry, the service principal needs an 
	additional role assigned called AcrPull
create the Azure Kubernetes Service instance
az role assignment create --assignee $SP_ID --scope $ACR_ID --role AcrPull

we call az aks create with the ‑‑resource‑group. And remember, we set these variables back in the clip
 when we configure the Azure Container Registry, then the name of the Kubernetes Service to create. We'll
 create two nodes, so there will be two VMs running our Pods. We'll generate SSH keys and attach this
 Kubernetes Service to the Azure Container Registry we created earlier, and we'll use the service principal
 credentials. Let's run this. And I actually forgot to set the value of the password to a variable, so let's
 create that variable. And I'll copy that password from the text file where we pasted the service principal
 info earlier. Okay, now we can run this. So this is kicking off the creation of these resources.
az aks create --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $AKS_NAME --node-count 2 --generate-ssh-keys --attach-acr $ACR_NAME --service-principal $SP_ID --client-secret $SP_PASSWORD
